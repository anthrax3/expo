Expo, a nickname for the expeditor, is a position in a restaurant kitchen (aka back-of-the-house aka BoH) whose job it is to organize the firing of orders for food & make sure they get sent to the right table. In this case, the expo's job is to make sure orders get delivered by the right courier to the right address. This project was built with the intention to demonstrate my skills with React, Redux, ES6, Babel, Gulp and CSS and to learn more about the basics of Node and npm. For more detail on the process I used (quite a lot of detail honestly), please refer to my [List of Tasks, Bugs & Fixes](https://github.com/patriciarealini/expo/blob/master/tasking.md).
